If you want to contribute feel free to do so. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/kevingimbel/vhost), create your feature and send in a pull request.

For easier handling please do the following:

1. Write meaningful commit messages wherever needed. See [this one for example](https://github.com/kevingimbel/vhost/commit/39513df2e52935ddba6137efb98130ac8e4cc893)
2. Describe what your feature does in the pull request comment
3. **DO NOT** expect to be merged. This is not how contributing works, your feature might be rejected. However, if I reject your feature I will give a explanation why this is so.
